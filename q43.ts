//caars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


import{features} from "process";


function createCar(manufacturer : string, model: string, ...extraOption:{[key :string]: any}[] ):
Object {
 const carInfo= {
     manufacturer,
     model,
     ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOption)
 }
 return carInfo;
};

let answer =  createCar ('Honda',' Civic',{colour:'silver'},{features:['Navigation', 'power window']})
console.log(answer);
